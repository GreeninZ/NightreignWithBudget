This mod has it's own savefile "bored.sl2" with "MoreWeaponsTM" or you can use seamless coop's "NR0000.co" with "MoreWeaponsTM_SC" (SC is not included in this download).
If you're using Bored/SC and you don't want to start new then you should go into your saves folder and <<<create a copy>>> of your main save then rename the copy to the save you want to replace.
It is heavily recommended to not use your main/online save or replace your main save with bored/SC's as there's a potential chance of you getting banned.

This mod is unfinished and currently won't use any sounds that aren't already in nightreign so stuff will be missing if I didn't replace it or it may sound wrong.
It will also most likely be heavily unbalanced and some stuff like reviving may be a bit wonky since I haven't gone in and changed many of those values yet.
If you do find certain weapons very overpowered/underpowered or you think they aren't working correctly please leave a comment on the mod explaining what happened.
I haven't had enough time to test everything myself so feedback is appreciated.
