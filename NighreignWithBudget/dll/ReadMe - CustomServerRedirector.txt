CL_SERVER_REDIRECTOR aka Nightreign Server Redirector made by Church Guard

How to use:
Running the launcher will automatically locate Nightreign.exe via Steam and
run it with the redirector dll mod. These files can be placed anywhere
convenient to you.

That's it.

In the default configuration the game will use a CL_SAVE file and connect
to a currently temporary but possibly permanent server emulator.
(more details about the server will be made available via its login message)

Q&A:

Q: Why would I use this?
A: With a custom server it enables players to enjoy the passive 
   multiplayer aspects along with matchmaking with people running the same mod.

Q: What if two people with different mods use the server?
A: The redirector dll can detect different mods and separate those users
   into different pools. The mod detection method is not perfect but will
   work most of the time.

Q: How do invites work?
A: Inviting a player to your game works almost the exact same. The other player
   will need to already have the game running, since accepting the invite 
   from Steam on its own will launch the retail game and they'll fail to join.

Q: Can I use this with seamless?
A: No.

Q: Will this ban me?
A: So long as you don't use the same save file for modded and unmodded play
   and don't set the custom server url to the official fromsoft server url.
   This mod wont ban you from official servers. Independent server operators
   may ban users at their discretion.

Q: I keep seeing the letters CL everywhere, why?
A: The internal "codename" or "designation" for Nightreign was CL
   I just decided to use it.
